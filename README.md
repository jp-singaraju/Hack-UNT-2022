**Project**

My team and I submitted Spaceverse for the UNTHack2022 Competition.

**What is Spaceverse?**

The inspiration for our project came from the lack of consolidation regarding space information. With the advent of new information in possibly every subject, it is very hard to find information about a specific topic in one place. As a result of this lack of information, people are unable to understand the complexities of the universe. With recent developments in space travel and human space technology, humanity should be well-educated on possible frontiers within the universe. Enter, social media! Social media is pervasive in society today. Why not make a social media based education platform that is game-based? Our aim is to turn the process of education into a fun game. We want to incentivize learning about humanity's future in space by rewarding users that help spread knowledge. Spaceverse is a novel space-based education software. Simply put, it is a knowledge sharing platform, combining the services of Instagram with Google, Facebook with YouTube, and so forth. The goal of Spaceverse is to educate the community about the universe by consolidating information from news websites, allowing users to contribute information by creating videos/websites, and gamifying the process of learning.
